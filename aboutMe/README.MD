## This is a page about Katharine Lundblad
<p> Welcome to  my personal page. </p>

### Introduction üëß
<p> Hello! My name is Katharine and I am a junior at the University of Washington.
I have been going to the school for three years, and I study in the Department
of Electrical and Computer Engineering. </>

### My Story üë∂
<p> I was born in 2002. I am half Chinese
and half Caucasian. My favorite time of the year is Summer. My favorite color
is blue. My go-to Starbucks order is a grande oatmilk latte. When I am not in 
school I am probably in the pool. My favorite item of clothing are my boots because
it is cold and rainy in Seattle right now. If I were to choose between the sweet,
salty, and spicy domains I would choose the spicy one. My favorite item at Trader
Joes is the Jerk-Style Plantain Chips. I think my favorite movie is the Rocky Horror
Picture Show, but at one point it was Joker. The movie I am most looking forward to seeing
this year is the Barbie Movie. My least favorite gym exercise are Burpees. My favorite
strokes to swim are Butterfly and Freestyle. The best coffee drink Starbucks has to offer
is their brown sugar oat milk shaken espresso. One thing I am tired of is rain. One thing
I would like UW to offer more is sun. </p>
